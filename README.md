# Eclipse Fix

## Whatawhy
This is a mod for RoR2 that makes Corpsebloom an actual item on Eclipse 5+, it also disables Transcendence from eclipse runs so you can no longer cheese every eclipse level with 1 item.

I made it 'cause i'm a Corpsebloom enjoyer and also dislike how 1 item breaks the entire gamemode. (Also because [LunarRework](https://thunderstore.io/package/Prototype/LunarRework/) doesn't have configuration)

## Attribution
This mod ports some of the features of [LunarRework](https://thunderstore.io/package/Prototype/LunarRework/) as a standalone mod. Go check it out!
